# ðŸš€ Ableton Website Clone

After going through Parcel, Webpack and manual compilers, I've settled on AstroJS! Before jumping straight into making website for my clients with Astro, I've taken the time to build this clone of the relatively complex website, [ableton.com](https://www.ableton.com).

Ableton is one of the many websites featured on[ frontendpractice.com](https://frontendpractice.com), and I credit FEP for my initial discovery of Ableton.

The website, so far, is being constructed with AstroJS (duh), SCSS and a little vanilla JavaScript. I plan to add functionality for Vue JS once I've mastered the arts of JS frameworks effectively.

For now, please have a look at what I've done at [abletonclone.netlify.app](https://abletonclone.netlify.app)
